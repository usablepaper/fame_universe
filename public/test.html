    You can’t say NFTs have no real-world applications. Over the past several months, holders of The Hundreds’ “Adam Bomb” NFTs have been getting
    tattoos of their bombs.
</p>
<p>
    They depict the cartoon-bomb mascot of the Los Angeles-based streetwear label rendered in
    <a href="https://twitter.com/timmayeur/status/1489828777836359681"><strong>squiggly lines</strong></a> or
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hdejoy/status/1488339466548703232"><strong>leopard print</strong></a
    >, transformed <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyhundreds/status/1489845418850611200/photo/2"><strong>into a skull</strong></a> or
    <a href="https://twitter.com/sybariteturtle/status/1487272397765951490"><strong>a strawberry</strong></a> or, in the case of
    <a href="https://twitter.com/_jgreez/status/1491135553521479680"><strong>one wearing a helmet</strong></a
    >, accessorised. Bobby Hundreds, the brand’s co-founder and creative director, has occasionally tweeted shots of the tattoos. Members of the Adam
    Bomb Squad, as holders of the 25,000 non-fungible tokens are known, are also making bomb-themed artwork and clothing, doing weekly hangouts on
    Twitter Spaces and organising meetups in real life, without The Hundreds’ involvement, he said.
</p>
<p>
    The mood has been different at times among holders of Adidas’ “Into the Metaverse” NFTs. When Adidas first released them in December 2021 in
    collaboration with influential partners in the NFT space — Bored Ape Yacht Club, Punks Comic and the investor Gmoney — they quickly sold out, even
    at the cost of 0.2 ETH, or around $765 at the time. But after the initial excitement, holders gradually became restless in Adidas’ Discord channel
    as they waited for more details on the project’s “roadmap,” the term for the different utilities and benefits the NFTs will unlock in phases over
    time. Adidas has since revealed its plans, reassuring many members. It said in a statement that this is a new space for the company and it will
    continue to listen to and learn from its community.
</p>
<p>
    The examples illustrate some of the promise and perils around NFTs as brands explore how to make them more than just collectables. The Hundreds,
    Adidas and Gucci are among those using them as a form of membership programme. Because NFTs can act as unique identifiers for their
    owners — similar to an email address but with added features because of the programmable smart contracts underlying them — brands can use them to
    extend holders privileges and perks, including freebies and exclusive access to new products.

<p><strong>The Future of Loyalty</strong></p>
<p>
    The Hundreds’ NFT program has been successful in large part because it has created a genuine sense of shared ownership. Earlier this year, the
    brand <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamBombSquad/status/1487896130977337347"><strong>started issuing them royalties on sales</strong></a> when it
    uses their bombs in products. For now, that means store credit to spend with the brand, Hundreds said, to avoid running afoul of securities
    regulations.
</p>
<p>
    The move is in keeping with the ethos of web3, an envisioned evolution of the internet toward a decentralised, blockchain-based architecture that
    theoretically promotes collective ownership. Yuga Labs, creator of the highly successful Bored Ape Yacht Club brand, grants commercialisation
    rights to Bored Ape holders, and it gave the same rights to owners of CryptoPunks and Meebits NFTs after acquiring those collections.

<p><strong>FAME’s Take on Fashion NFTs</strong></p>
<p>
    The hyper-connected fashion NFT protocol FAME allows the brands to build such relationship with holders, and holders to benefit directly from
    holding the NFTs in multiple ways. The hyper connected events that connects the brands and holders including the FAME Metaverse FAshion Week
    allows the brands to hold offline connection with buyers, giving exclusive benefits at the events. FAME Crowd Funding system allows the holders to
    receive direct perks and physical products by purchasing digital fashion NFTs, as well as participate in the production process itself, making
    their own choices become a real collection.
</p>
<p>
    As the fashion NFTs are becoming a new way for the brand to form a firm relationship with customers, fashion NFTs will be more than just
    collectibles but will rather function as a real mode of communication for both parties. For more information on FAME’s NFTs, marketplace, and
    upcoming events, visit the FAME website and social media channels listed below.
