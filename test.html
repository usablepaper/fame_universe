    <p>Beauty’s next wave of tech innovation is happening in the metaverse.</p>
    <p>
      Much attention has been dedicated to fashion’s activity in the space, from
      luxury brands like Gucci and Balenciaga launching experiences in online
      virtual worlds to labels like Etro and Dolce &amp; Gabbana presenting
      collections at Metaverse Fashion Week.
    </p>
    <p>
      But beauty has also been active: over the past two years, a number of
      brands, including Dior, Gucci, Clinique, Givenchy Parfums, Charlotte
      Tilbury, Nars and Guerlain have begun to embrace — or at least try
      out — the metaverse and web3, creating products for avatars and NFTs as
      well as virtual storefronts, experiences and games. In 2022 alone, L’Oréal
      filed 17 trademarks for virtual cosmetics and Estée Lauder partnered with
      Decentraland’s Metaverse Fashion Week.

      The beauty industry also has a history of being quick to adopt new
      technologies, such as augmented reality for virtual try-ons, and beauty
      consumers are used to seeing this sort of innovation from brands. Added to
      that, beauty purchases are hyper-personal, tied to identity and
      self-esteem and happen across a mix of physical and virtual channels that
      mimics the metaverse, says Depraeter-Montacel.

      “Beauty is very much about creating worlds and an environment,” said
      Melissa Kelly, chief operating officer of creative agency M+A Group. “It …
      lends itself to this kind of metaverse-and-NFT model.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The potential for new revenue streams and methods for consumer engagement
      is there. But the metaverse is

        ><strong>still underdeveloped</strong></a
      >. Brands, creatives, consumers and developers alike remain mostly in the
      dark about what exactly it will look like in the next few years — or even
      the next several weeks. Still, beauty brands recognise that it’s better to
      test it out than be left behind.

    <p><strong>Beauty’s Virtual Future</strong></p>
    <p>
      As brands grapple with how to use the “newest arrow in [their] quiver,” as
      Miller calls it, he suggests they start by considering their own goals and
      objectives as a guide to why and how they should appear in metaverse
      spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s an important time for every brand to rethink what their purpose for
      being is,” said Miller. “What are they really trying to do? It’s an
      opportunity to reset and really crystalise what’s important to them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in developing their strategy, brands need to hire people who
      understand both the long and short-term possibilities and limitations of
      different platforms, said Box.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don’t have to just do a digital double of a real-world product. We
      are actually moving into a space where you have the chance to rewrite the
      script,” she said. “It’s about having somebody on the team that
      understands the semantics.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Development of the metaverse is early days, but waiting around means
      missing out on learning opportunities and relationship building. Brands
      shouldn’t just enter the metaverse because it’s an interesting prospect,
      but rather, because that’s where consumers already are and conversations
      are already happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Beauty brands need this audience,” said Depraeter-Montacel. “This is
      their target.”
